Customer Segmentation Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on customer segmentation using unsupervised machine learning techniques. By analyzing customer data, the model identifies distinct groups (segments) to help businesses tailor their marketing strategies, improve customer engagement, and boost revenue.

Project Overview
Objective: Cluster customers into meaningful segments based on purchasing behavior and demographic attributes.

Techniques Used:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data preprocessing and scaling

K-Means Clustering

Visualization of clusters using PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

Key Features
Data cleaning and preprocessing

Optimal cluster selection using the Elbow Method

Customer segmentation with K-Means

Visualizations to interpret and understand different customer groups

Technologies and Tools
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

How to Run

Clone the repository.

Install required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt (you can generate one if needed).

Open customer-segmentation.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

Run all cells step-by-step.

Results

The model successfully identified distinct customer groups based on key features, enabling better-targeted marketing efforts and business strategies.

Future Work

Test with different clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering)

Use additional features for deeper segmentation

Build an interactive dashboard for real-time segmentation updates
